The prototype game prepared for Mini Jame Gam #18

# Description:
Help Brush reach his beloved Pencil in this exciting adventure!

But be careful not to go into a color that is not currently paintable for Brush.  His tender nature prevents him from going through a color he's not currently painting, but lucky for us, there are these cool magic paint barrels along the levels to help change the color of your current paint color

Probably, Brush has too outplayed Tron like games but who are we to judge the Brush in the bow tie, haha!

# Controls:
Only the arrow keys or WADS

Of course, except for the buttons in the menu
